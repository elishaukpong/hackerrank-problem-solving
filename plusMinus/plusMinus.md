# Plus Minus Problem Detail

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with `6` places after the decimal.

**Note:** This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to `10 ^-4` are acceptable.


## Function Description

Complete the plusMinus function in the editor below.

plusMinus has the following parameter(s):

- int arr[n]: an array of integers

## Print

Print the ratios of positive, negative and zero values in the array. Each value should be printed on a separate line with `6` digits after the decimal. The function should not return a value.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, `n`, the size of the array.
The second line contains `n` space-separated integers that describe `arr[n]`.

##Constraints

```0 < n <= 100```
```-100 <= arr[i] <= 100```
