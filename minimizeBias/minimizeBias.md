# Minimize Bias Problem

### IGNORE THIS PROBLEM, I PUT IT HERE FOR RECORD KEEPING


This was an interview question that I solved for a job, but wasn't able to make all the use-cases pass, and I do not have access to the test inputs to really find out where the disparity came from.

The idea was to pick the list amount of bias in a group of numbers.

say given a set of even count numbers `[3,5,4,2,9,10]`, find the numbers that have the least difference and sum it.

In the above case, `10 - 9 = 1` `3 - 2 = 1` `5 - 4 = 1`

So the minimum bias is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
